buy soundcloud plays to boost your soundcloud promotion

We often get asked about the best way to buy soundcloud plays. A lot of artists think that all they need to do for their soundcloud promotion, is dump a few thousand plays on their tracks and the labels will come and break down their door to sign them. Sorry that isn't going to happen. However, Soundcloud play stats boosting is part of a well rounded soundcloud promotion campaign, and <a href="http://soundcloudmanager.com/buy-soundcloud-plays.html">boosting soundcloud plays</a> can help get your track noticed, but it must be a part of your promotional strategy. A full promotional <a href="http://soundcloud.com" rel="nofollow">Soundcloud</a>  campaign requires all aspect of Soundcloud being covered, including: stats (plays, likes, comments, reposts), interactions and reaching out to other other users and lastly, making sure all track information is set including track artwork, track description, accurate tags etc.

When artists want to buy soundcloud plays, they always, without fail, think more is best. But a track with 100k plays is no better, from a Soundcloud Promotion view, than a track with 5000 plays. So stop wasting money buying soundcloud plays. Actually, stop wasting money buying plays full stop. Want to know a secret? There are many programs you can buy that will allow you to give unlimited numbers of plays, probably cheaper than you are paying for your soundcloud services. The one that is currently dominating all Soundcloud promotion tools, is "soundcloud manager", definitely recommend you check that out.

So now we have a track with a good few thousand plays, we need to start getting real users to the track page, this is what it is all about. Some artists who buy soundcloud services seem to think it is all about having high stats, it isn't, these stats and play boosts are about getting REAL USERS to your page, never forget that. 

The way to get real soundcloud users to your page is to interact with other users. Like tracks, follow users, repost tracks, make play lists of other users tracks, comment on tracks, send out messages. All these actions cause the user to get a notification that another user has been interacting with their music. A percentage then want to know who this is and will check your profile page out. Bingo, we have traffic.

Now just keep this up, do more of it. The more you do, the more you get back.
